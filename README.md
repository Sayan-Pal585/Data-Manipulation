# Data-Manipulation
Manipulating Datasets required for Analyzing.

# Percentile Capping (Winsorization)
In layman's terms, Winsorization (Winsorizing) at 1st and 99th percentile implies values that are less than the value at 1st percentile are replaced by the value at 1st percentile, and values that are greater than the value at 99th percentile are replaced by the value at 99th percentile. The winsorization at 5th and 95th percentile is also common.

# Standardization / Scaling
The concept of standardization comes into picture when continuous independent variables are measured at different scales. It means these variables do not give equal contribution to the analysis. For example, we are performing customer segmentation analysis in which we are trying to group customers based on their homogenous (similar) attributes. A variable called 'transaction amount' that ranges between $100 and $10000 carries more weightage as compared to a variable i.e. number of transactions that in general ranges between 0 and 30. Hence, it is required to transform the data to comparable scales. The idea is to rescale an original variable to have equal range and/or variance.

# Methods of Standardization / Normalization

There are main four methods of standardization. They are as follows -

Z score

Z score standardization is one of the most popular method to normalize data. In this case, we rescale an original variable to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.

Z=(x-mean)/std.dev
Mathematically, scaled variable would be calculated by subtracting mean of the original variable from raw vale and then divide it by standard deviation of the original variable.

# Min-Max Scaling

It is also called 0-1 scaling because the standardized value using this method lies between 0 and 1.

x-min(x)/(max(x)-min(x))

# Standard Deviation Method

In this method, we divide each value by the standard deviation. The idea is to have equal variance, but different means and ranges. Formula : x/stdev(x)

# Range Method

In this method, we dividing each value by the range. Formula : x /(max(x) - min(x)). In this case, the means, variances, and ranges of the variables are still different, but at least the ranges are likely to be more similar.

# What is Centering?

Centering means subtracting a constant value from every value of a variable. The constant value can be average, min or max. Most of the times we use average value to subtract it from every value.

# When it is important to standardize variables?

1. It is important to standardize variables before running Cluster Analysis. It is because cluster analysis techniques depend on the concept of measuring the distance between the different observations we're trying to cluster. If a variable is measured at a higher scale than the other variables, then whatever measure we use will be overly influenced by that variable.

2. Prior to Principal Component Analysis, it is critical to standardize variables. It is because PCA gives more weightage to those variables that have higher variances than to those variables that have very low variances. In effect the results of the analysis will depend on what units of measurement are used to measure each variable. Standardizing raw values makes equal variance so high weight is not assigned to variables having higher variances.

3. It is required to standardize variable before using k-nearest neighbors with an Euclidean distance measure. Standardization makes all variables to contribute equally.

4. All SVM kernel methods are based on distance so it is required to scale variables prior to running final Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

5. It is necessary to standardize variables before using Lasso and Ridge Regression. Lasso regression puts constraints on the size of the coefficients associated to each variable. However, this value will depend on the magnitude of each variable. The result of centering the variables means that there is no longer an intercept. This applies equally to ridge regression.

6. In regression analysis, we can calculate importance of variables by ranking independent variables based on the descending order of absolute value of standardized coefficient.

7. In regression analysis, when an interaction is created from two variables that are not centered on 0, some amount of collinearity will be induced. Centering first addresses this potential problem. In simple terms, having non-standardized variables interact simply means that when X1 is big, then X1X2 is also going to be bigger on an absolute scale irrespective of X2, and so X1 and X1X2 will end up correlated.

8. In regression analysis, it is also helpful to standardize a variable when you include power terms XÂ². Standardization removes collinearity.

# When it is not required to standardize variables

1. If you think model performance of linear regression model would improve if you standardize variables, it is absolutely incorrect! It does not change RMSE, R-squared value, Adjusted R-squared value, p-value of coefficients. See the detailed R script below. It shows standardization does not affect model performance at all.
